            In this new page you create…
            After a user has entered a search term, we need to display the results of the search
            back to the user, so that they can click through to the page(s) that match their search.

            This page needs the following structure:

              - A header that includes:
                - the name of the page
                - a summary of the number of results
                - the entered search term.
                - a link back to search again, at "/search"
              - A list of page results that match the term, which should include:
                - The page title
                - A link to the page
                - A summary of where the entered search term matches the page

            Here is the entered search term: "critical thinking"

            And here are the results, with their excerpts:
